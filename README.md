# Test Task 

Created simple app according to task description.

Used clean architecture approach with MVVM presentation layer organization.

I had difficulties with creating payment account for Google Directions Api and had no enough time to use another api. Instead of implementing directions like described in the task I implemented redirecting to maps app with route to point.

Added ```TODO``` with description where I didn't have enough time to finish.

Added a few unit tests.
